- Add server to inventory list.
- Install RAM.
  - Note if the motherboard requires error-correcting (EEC) RAM or a specific kind of DDR.
  - Use approximately 2Gb per CPU.
- Install drives.
  - Prefer drives that have been tested with SMART, if they are available.
  - State that these drives are used in this machine in the inventory list.
- Install into server rack.
- Plug in a mouse, keyboard, and screen.
- Turn off RAID card in BIOS. Hardware RAID requires a priorietary chip that can be difficult to procure if the chip fails. We prefer software RAID.
  - If RAID is unable to be turned off, we created as many virtual disks as physical disks.
    - During the boot sequence immediately following the Dell logo appearing, hit Ctrl+R.
    - Select the VD Mgmt screen
    - For each physical disk:
      - Highlight the RAID Card (e.g., PERC H700)
      - Press F2
      - Create new virtual disk
      - Use RAID 0, because we want to passthrough as directly as possible to the OS
      - Select that physical disk.
      - Leave everything to their defaults
- Download the "Boot" image of https://rockylinux.org/download for your arch (probably x86_64). We decided to use RockyLinux because RHEL has gooood documentation and resources.
  - On package selection screen:
    - Minimal install with Standard, Headless Management, and System Tools package groups.
  - On network screen:
    - Enable network.
    - Set the hostname to <model number keyword>-<human-readable>.
    - Print a physical laber for the server with the label maker.
    - Plug in an ethernet cable to top-of-rack switch.
    - Make sure the port is enabled in IRIS. It should be already.
  - On Time and Date screen:
    - Select Chicago.
    - Enable NTP.
      - Use ntp.illinois.edu.
  - On installation destination:
    - Select the first virtual disk (sda).
    - Set "Storage Configuration" to custom,
    - Click "Done" to edit partitions.
    - Make the following partitions:
      - 300Mib EFI System Parition /boot/efi (Standard Partition).
      - 100Gib xfs partition for / (Standard Partition).
      - Set swap partition (Standard Partition).
      - Rule of thumb, set swap equal to the amount of RAM.
  - On password screen:
    - Set the Root Password to a passphrase
